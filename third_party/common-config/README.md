# symbiflow-common-config

[SymbiFlow](https://symbiflow.github.io/) aims to produce a completely open source FPGA design toolchain.
The organization has a large presence on github with many repositories.
One of the challenges with such a large effort is imposing some order and uniformity on the various repositories so that they all use the same code formatting, copyright licensing, documentation style, etc.
One of the open [issues](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/51) on [SymbiFlow/ideas](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas) relates to creating a single common configuration github repository which is then included into every other repository to provide the desired uniformity.
This project focuses on creating such a common configuration repository and modifying all other repositories to use it.
To learn more, see [Issue 51](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/51) on the SymbiFlow Ideas repository.

This document contains descriptions of the files in the repository. To find a detailed plan on how common-config will be updated/implemented in the future, see [`implementation_guide.md`](implementation_guide.md)
